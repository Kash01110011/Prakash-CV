            <p>With over 7 years of experience in the construction industry, I have developed a strong foundation in project management, contract administration, and resource management. My advanced degrees in Civil Engineering and Construction Management from Swinburne University of Technology, as well as my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from Vinayaka Missions University, have equipped me with a wealth of knowledge and skills that I have applied to various projects throughout my career.
            <p>As a Contract Administrator, Project Engineer, and Project Manager at various companies, I have had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects including childcares, apartment buildings, CFA fire stations, council buildings, flood recovery road works, Stuart Highway rehabilitation, Grampians peaks trail, and Dunkeld dam. In these roles, I have gained valuable experience in managing and scheduling resource requirements, reviewing and interpreting engineering designs and specifications, preparing financial reports and cost forecasts, and managing subcontractor claims.
            <p>I have a strong track record of success in project management, with extensive experience in estimation, tendering, variation preparation and assessment, project programming, and contract management. I have a proven ability to deliver projects on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of clients.</p>
            <p>In addition to my technical skills in civil engineering and construction management, I also have a strong knowledge of SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and cloud computing. I have used these skills to create my own websites and web apps, and I am always seeking new ways to innovate and create value in the industry. My entrepreneurial spirit and passion for technology have led me to explore the possibility of starting my own company, where I can apply my skills and experience to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact.</p>
            <p>I have also completed courses on AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals and Web Development Bootcamp in addition to a Diploma in Generic CADD and Façade CADD, which has helped me develop a range of technical skills that are valuable in the construction industry. I have achieved a number of professional milestones, including being a member of the Golden Key International Honor Society at Swinburne University, and successfully completing a number of construction projects on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of clients.</p>
            <p>I am a driven and ambitious professional, always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow in the industry. My thirst for knowledge and my desire to push the boundaries of what is possible drive me to constantly seek out new challenges and seek out new ways to make a difference. I welcome the chance to connect with other professionals in the field, and I am always open to discussing new ideas and opportunities.</p>
